This folder will contain all of the plots of the river flow for all gages in Rivermaps.co. 
The plots are listed by USGS number. This is the best way to organize so many plots. I may create a legend later to correspend to the river section you want and I will upload these to Rivermaps.co and link to the specific sites there, but this will do for now.
